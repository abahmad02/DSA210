# Abdullah Ahmad - DSA 210 Project
Proposal:
I want to work on using my data from instagram, particularly, messages to analyze my instagram usage. I want to check the messages / reels that I have sent to a particular friend of mine over a period of time. The data was obtained from the instagram app after lodging a request. That data will be parsed via Beautiful soup as the data that instagram provides is in an HTML format. After the data has been parsed, it will be saved in a CSV File for easier access afterwards. 
I want to show that I send more messages to my friend and for that, I wish to create a hypothesis proving that I send more messages.
Data will be visualised as a bar chart to show the count of messages per day between me and my friend. To prove my hypothesis, I can conduct a proportion or chi-square test to see if my hypothesis holds true or not.

As of now:
Null Hypothesis: I and Friend X send an equal proportion of messages.
Alternative Hypothesis : I send more messages than Friend X.

Therefore, the question I wish to answer is: Who sends more messages between me and my friend? 

I expect to find that I send more messages than my friend, both overall and on a daily basis.

Using the bar charts and the results from the hypothesis tests, I want to see if my claim holds true.
